= JCloudScale = 

JCloudScale is a Java-based framework for building transparently scaling cloud applications. The goal of JCloudScale is that users can write elastic cloud applications (i.e., applications that dynamically acquire and release resources from a cloud) just like regular Java apps, and let JCloudScale deal with the cloud.

All in all, JCloudScale handles the following tasks:

* '''Remoting''' (applications look like regular, local Java applications - remoting between different hosts is handled by JCloudScale)
* '''Virtual machine management''' (applications don't need to keep track of virtual resources they have acquired from the cloud)
* '''Application monitoring''' (JCloudScale has an integrated event-based monitoring system, which allows applications to keep track of their performance)
* '''Code distribution''' (applications don't need to care about getting their code to newly created virtual machines) 

To simplify a bit, you can think of JCloudScale as your personal Platform-as-a-Service middleware.
